### Jekyll Install

First of all, you need to install Jekyll on your PC. If you don't know how to install Jekyll on your PC, here is great [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) for beginners.

### Theme Install

After installing Jekyll on your pc, [download](https://github.com/themefisher/northendlab-jekyll) the theme from this repository. Unzip it and run `bundle exec jekyll server` to run this template on your localhost.

### Main Configuration

You don't need to change anything in the main configuration (`_config.yml`), just you need to change the `baseURL` when you host this template.

You will find every parameter in `_data/parameters.yml`` this file.

#### Navigation Menu

You can set the main menu and footer menu also from `_data/parameters.yml`, just follow the existing loop for creating a new menu item. This theme also supports the dropdown menu.

### Creating New Post

For creating a new blog post, you need to go to the `_posts` folder and create a new file. Make sure you are creating this file name with the existing post name structure which is `year-month-date-post-name.md`. (i.e `2020-02-06-my-awesome-blog.md`). Then follow the existing post front-matter to configure it. Or you can simply copy an existing post and replace its content.

### Creating a New Author

This is the same process for the blog post. Copy an existing author file, and replace your content and file name.

### Customize Other Pages

Another page customization (like about, contact) is very easy. You can see the other page in the `_pages/` folder. Find the page that you want to customize, and change the content from it. If this page has any loop item, then follow the existing loop to create a new one.
